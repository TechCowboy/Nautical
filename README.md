# mountainShooter
A 2D Python LAN-Game with a randomly generated terrain in which you can build, shoot rockets and upgrade yourself.
# Features
## 1) The Menu
In the menu you will be able to either start a lan game or join one, set the resolution and to look at the contributors.
## 2) The Game
The two players spawn at random positions and you are able to move them around freely, but they can't see each other. Then you can go to Supply Drops in which you can find iron, with which you can build ground-air missles, auto-shooting super missles and much more. You yourself can shoot rockets with energy, which is generated after a time. The maximum of energy you can carry is 10. But you can upgrade that later. The two rocket types you are able to shoot are small missles with a short range, that cost 2 energy and big missles with a high range, that cost 4 energy. The Terrain is uneven, so it is a good strategy to get to a high point as soon as the game begins, because short range missles loose range if you need to shoot them at e.g. a high mountain and high range missles too, even though they've got a high range. You can't see the enemy. However you've got an radar in which you can see rockets from the enemy closing in and the enemy himself, but the radar hasn't got a high range, so the enemy rockets would need to be close so you would be able see them.
